## Project Name
NFT LUXURY WINE

## Project Scope
Create a Physically-Redeemable marketplace for wines

## Description
 Luxury Wine NFT Marketplace is based on openZeppelin ERC721 contracts.
 The goal of the project is allow winery to mint wine associated to real bottle and sell it as physical-digital assets.
 Marketplace Users can:
 - buy 
 - sell
 - set on sale / not on sale status
 - set new price
 
 At the moment the minting process is not automated that means Winery needs to upload nft image on IPFS (ex. through pinata service) and mint manually one by one. In the future the entire process will be automated.
 Default uri for testing: https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZUn1TJScL9m51fyqm1Pnx6HtCNTci2v3FvukuSSfshYM/

 In the next future will be integrated the possiblity to redeem the bottle asking to the winery to ship at specific address (after authentication).
